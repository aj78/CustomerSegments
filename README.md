# CustomerSegments
This project uses Unsupervised learning techniques on real world general demographics data from a country and then applies
it on a company's customer dataset to identify potential customer segments for the company. 
After performing missing data analysis, preprocessing and feature engineering, Principal component analysis is performed on
the features to reduce the dimsenioanlity and then the data is clustered. 
The customer's data is then mapped to these clusters to identify over-representation and under-representation.
